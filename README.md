## 'eyup - I'm Joseph Banham, a 23 y/o Front-End Developer based in Leeds, United Kingdom.

#### ðŸ”´ Sorry! I'm not currently looking for new work.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **React**, **TypeScript**, **GraphQL** and **Next.js**

ðŸ¤” I have 5 years' experience with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, **SCSS / SASS**, **ES6 JS**, **SQL** and a little bit of **Java**. I'm also used to working in a **Hybris** and **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)** oriented environment, using **Git**, **Gulp**, **NPM** and **Bitbucket**. Oh, and I'm also awesome at **Adobe Target A/B Testing**!

ðŸ˜„ My pronouns: He / Him

âš¡ Fun fact! I used to go under the name 'Joseph Gribble', but changed my last name to honour my late father, who sadly passed in 2017. Wait. That wasn't fun!!

âš¡ Let's try this again... Fun fact! I'm a self-proclaimed videogame collector (...hoarder.) who has over 500 physical games... Guess I need to get a basement or warehouse soon...
